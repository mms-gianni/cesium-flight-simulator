# Cesium Flight Simulator

A 3D flight simulator built with Cesium, React, and TypeScript. Fly aircraft or drive a car across real-world terrain with multiple camera modes and a mini-map.

## Features

- **Multiple Vehicles** - Switch between aircraft and car
- **Camera Modes** - Follow, close follow, and drone cameras
- **Real Terrain** - Built on Cesium's global 3D terrain data
- **Mini-Map** - Real-time position tracking with Mapbox
- **Location Teleport** - Jump to famous locations instantly
- **Quality Presets** - Performance, balanced, quality, and ultra modes
- **Crash Detection** - Aircraft collision detection with terrain

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Free API tokens from Mapbox and Cesium Ion

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cesium-flight-simulator.git
cd cesium-flight-simulator/packages/web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will prompt you for API tokens on first launch, or you can create a `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
VITE_CESIUM_TOKEN=your_cesium_token_here
```

### Getting API Tokens

**Mapbox Token** (for mini-map)
1. Sign up at [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/)
2. Copy your default public token (starts with `pk.`)

**Cesium Ion Token** (for 3D terrain)
1. Sign up at [cesium.com/ion](https://ion.cesium.com/tokens)
2. Copy your default access token

Both services are free for development use.

### Docker

You can build and run the project in a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image (from project root)
docker build -t cesium-flight-simulator .
```

Then run the container with your API tokens:
```bash
# Create a .env file from the example. You must edit it to add your tokens.
copy .env.example .env

# Run the container (exposes port 5173 by default)
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env cesium-flight-simulator
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

You will still need to provide your Mapbox and Cesium API tokens on first launch or via a `.env` file as described above.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` | Throttle |
| `S` | Brake |
| `A` / `D` / `←` / `→` | Roll |
| `C` | Switch camera |
| `M` | Toggle vehicle |
| `?` | Show controls |
| `~` | Debug panel |
